# Direction of Arrival Estimation using MUSIC (Floating and Fixed) and FFT Interpolation
MATLAB implementation of MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) Algorithm for estimation of direction of arrival (DoA) for Uniform Linear Arrays radar systems. Both Floating and Fixed Point implementations are done. Interpolated FFT is also added as a reference for MUSIC's accuracy
